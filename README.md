# Disk_interface
To ensure that the disk driver interface (AHCI/SCSI) functions correctly.


#**Preconditions**:

The test environment should be properly set up with the necessary hardware and software configurations.
The disk drive(s) to be tested should be connected and recognized by the system.
The test environment should have access to the dashboard for publishing test results.
Test Steps:

**Initialize Test Environment:**
Power on the test system.
Boot the operating system.


**Launch Test Automation Framework:**
Execute the test automation framework script/application.
Identify Disk Drives:
Retrieve the list of disk drives recognized by the system using the disk management commands/APIs.
Verify that all expected disk drives are listed.
**

Perform Interface Test:**
**For each identified disk drive:**
Issue commands/API calls to perform read/write operations on the disk.
Perform operations such as read/write, format, partition, etc.
Verify that the operations complete successfully without errors.
Monitor performance metrics like transfer rate, latency, and throughput.

**Verify Results:**
Check for any errors or exceptions during the test execution.
Record any failures or deviations from expected behavior.

**Publish Test Results:**
If all tests pass successfully:
Publish a "Pass" status for the disk driver interface test case on the dashboard.
**If any test fails:**
Publish a "Fail" status for the disk driver interface test case on the dashboard.
Include details of the failure, such as error messages or logs.
**Postconditions:**

**Test results are published to the dashboard.**
Any necessary cleanup or teardown of the test environment is performed.
